# Hand-Gesture-Paint
HandGesturePaint is a gesture-controlled painting application that leverages MediaPipe for hand detection and tracking, and OpenCV for drawing. Users can draw on a virtual canvas by moving their hand in front of a webcam. The application allows for color selection and clearing the canvas using specific hand gestures.
